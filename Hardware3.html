        <p>ONLY MUSIC. NOTHING ELSE.</p>
        <p>It's just you and your music with the WH-1000XM4 headphones.
            The easy way to enjoy less noise and even purer sound, with smart listening
            technology that automatically personalises your experience.</p>
            <fieldset>
                <legend><h3>Industry-Leading Noise Cancellation</h3></legend>
                <p>Whether you're flying long haul or relaxing in a café, the WH-1000XM4 headphones
                    deliver our best ever noise-cancelling performance, keeping out even more high- and mid-frequency sounds.</p>
                    <fieldset>
                        <legend><h4>The Technology That Makes It Happen</h4></legend>
                        <p>Dual noise sensor technology, featuring two microphones on each earcup, captures ambient noise
                            and passes the data to the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1. Using a new algorithm,
                            the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1 then applies noise-cancelling processing in real time
                            to a range of acoustic environments. Working together with a new Bluetooth® Audio SoC (System on Chip),
                            it senses and adjusts to music and noise signals, as well as acoustic characteristics between the
                            driver unit and ears, at over 700 times per second.</p>
                    </fieldset>
                    <fieldset>
                        <legend><h4>Optimising Noise Cancelling</h4></legend>
                        <p>To maximise noise-cancelling, the WH-1000XM4 headphones incorporate two technologies:
                            Personal Noise-Cancelling Optimiser, designed specifically for you, and Atmospheric-Pressure Optimising,
                            designed specifically for air travel.</p>
                    </fieldset>
                    <fieldset>
                        <legend><h4>Ambient Sound Control</h4></legend>
                        <p>Adjust ambient sound with the Sony | Headphones Connect app to cancel noise while still allowing essential
                            sounds, like transport announcements, through when you're listening on the move.</p>

                <legend><h3>Wireless Freedom, Premium Sound</h3></legend>
                <p>LDAC transmits approximately three times more data (at the maximum transfer rate of 990 kbps) than conventional
                    BLUETOOTH® audio, allowing you to enjoy High-Resolution Audio content in exceptional quality,
                    as close as possible to that of a dedicated wired connection.</p>
                    <fieldset>
                        <legend><h4>Sound You Can Believe In</h4></legend>
                        <p>A built-in analogue amplifier integrated in the HD Noise Cancelling Processor QN1 realises an unmatched
                            signal-to-noise ratio for low distortion and exceptional sound quality for portable devices.
                            Powerful 40-mm drivers with Liquid Crystal Polymer (LCP) diaphragms make the headphones perfect for
                            handling heavy beats and can reproduce a full range of frequencies up to 40 kHz.</p>

                        <legend><h4>Real-Time Restoration Of All Your Compressed Files</h4></legend>
                        <p>Using Edge-AI (Artificial Intelligence), DSEE Extreme™ (Digital Sound Enhancement Engine) upscales
                            compressed digital music files in real time. Dynamically recognising instrumentation, musical genres
                            and individual elements of each song, such as vocals or interludes, it restores the high-range sound
                            lost in compression for a richer, more complete listening experience.</p>

                        <legend><h4>Smart Listening Technology To Enhance Your Listening</h4></legend>
                        <p>The WH-1000XM4 headphones use an array of smart technologies to create a seamless, hands-free listening
                            experience. For example, simply start speaking to automatically pause your music in Speak-to-Chat,
                            or enjoy adaptive playback thanks to a proximity sensor and two acceleration sensors that detect
                            whether your headphones are being worn or not.</p>
                    <fieldset>
                        <legend><h4>For Everyday convenience, Just Speak-to-Chat</h4></legend>
                        <p>As soon as you speak to someone, Speak-to-Chat automatically stops the music and lets in ambient sound
                            so you can conduct a conversation—handy if you want to keep your headphones on, or your hands are full.
                            Based on Precise Voice Pickup Technology, this smart feature uses five microphones built into your
                            headphones and advanced audio signal processing to recognise and react to your voice. And once your
                            chat is over, your music starts playing again automatically.</p>

                        <p>Adaptive Sound Control is a smart function that senses where you are and what you're doing, then adjusts ambient sound settings for the ideal listening experience.</p>
